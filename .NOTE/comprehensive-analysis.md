- Backend: Node.js 20, Fastify, PostgreSQL, Redis
- Real-time: Socket.io, Yjs CRDT
- Infrastructure: AWS, Docker, Kubernetes
- Security: Supabase Auth, JWT tokens

## Architecture Highlights

### Real-time Collaboration Strategy
**CRDT Implementation**: Chose Yjs for conflict-free collaborative editing
- Mathematically proven conflict resolution
- Better than Operational Transform for distributed systems
- Excellent Monaco Editor integration
- Handles offline/online synchronization

### Security-First Code Execution
**Multi-layered Sandboxing**:
- Docker containers with restricted privileges
- Resource limits (CPU, memory, execution time)
- Network isolation and read-only file systems
- Language-specific runtime environments

### Scalable Architecture
**Horizontal Scaling Design**:
- Stateless application servers
- Database read replicas and connection pooling
- Redis clustering for WebSocket scaling
- Container orchestration with Kubernetes

### Modern Development Practices
**TypeScript Throughout**: End-to-end type safety
**Comprehensive Testing**: Unit, integration, and E2E tests
**CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment
**Monitoring**: Application performance and error tracking

## Technical Innovation

### Collaborative Editing Engine
- Real-time multi-cursor support with user identification
- Conflict-free text synchronization using CRDT algorithms
- Efficient operation batching and network optimization
- Seamless offline/online state management

### Educational Features
- Session recording and playback capabilities
- Role-based permissions (instructor, learner, observer)
- Real-time code execution with output streaming
- Integrated debugging and error highlighting

### Performance Optimizations
- Code splitting and lazy loading for fast initial loads
- Efficient WebSocket message serialization
- Database query optimization with proper indexing
- CDN integration for global content delivery

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP-First Approach
**Phase 1**: Core functionality with basic collaboration
**Phase 2**: Enhanced editor features and real-time sync
**Phase 3**: Advanced collaboration and code execution
**Phase 4**: Production deployment and optimization

### Risk Mitigation
**Technical Risks**: Robust fallback mechanisms and proven technologies
**Timeline Risks**: Buffer time and modular architecture
**Quality Risks**: Comprehensive testing throughout development
**Security Risks**: Multiple layers of protection and regular audits

## Success Metrics

### Technical Performance
- Page load time < 2 seconds
- Real-time collaboration latency < 100ms
- 99.9% uptime with auto-scaling
- Support for 1000+ concurrent users

### User Experience
- Intuitive interface suitable for educational use
- Seamless real-time collaboration
- Fast code execution (< 5 seconds)
- Cross-browser compatibility

### Business Goals
- 1000+ registered users in first month
- > 70% monthly active user retention
- Average session duration > 30 minutes
- < 0.1% error rate

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript
2. Set up development environment with Docker
3. Configure Supabase for authentication
4. Create basic project structure and tooling

### Development Priorities
1. **Foundation**: Authentication, database, basic UI
2. **Core Editor**: Monaco integration and basic features
3. **Real-time**: WebSocket infrastructure and collaboration
4. **Execution**: Secure code execution sandbox
5. **Production**: Deployment, monitoring, optimization

## Conclusion

This architecture provides a comprehensive foundation for building a world-class collaborative coding education platform. The technology choices prioritize:

- **Developer Experience**: Modern tools and frameworks
- **Performance**: Optimized for real-time collaboration
- **Security**: Enterprise-grade security practices
