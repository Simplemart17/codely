# Architecture Analysis Notes

## Research Summary

### Current Workspace State
- Empty directory - starting from scratch
- No existing configuration or dependencies
- Clean slate for implementing the collaborative coding platform

### Key Research Findings

#### Real-time Collaboration Technologies
1. **Operational Transform (OT)**: Traditional approach used by Google Docs
   - Complex to implement correctly
   - Good for text-based collaboration
   - Requires careful conflict resolution

2. **Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDT)**: Modern approach
   - Mathematically proven conflict resolution
   - Better for distributed systems
   - Used by Figma and modern collaborative tools

3. **WebSockets**: Essential for real-time communication
   - Low latency bidirectional communication
   - Perfect for live coding sessions

#### Code Editor Solutions
1. **Monaco Editor** (VS Code's editor)
   - Excellent syntax highlighting for JS, Python, C#
   - Built-in IntelliSense and debugging support
   - Mature and well-maintained by Microsoft

2. **CodeMirror 6**: Lightweight alternative
   - Modular architecture
   - Good performance
   - Extensive plugin ecosystem

#### Code Execution Security
1. **Docker Containers**: Industry standard for sandboxing
   - Isolated execution environment
   - Resource limits and security boundaries
   - Supports all three target languages

2. **Serverless Functions**: Alternative approach
   - AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions
   - Built-in security and scaling
   - Pay-per-execution model

#### Technology Stack Considerations
- **Frontend**: React with Next.js for SSR and routing
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express or Fastify
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data, Redis for sessions
- **Real-time**: Socket.io for WebSocket management
- **Authentication**: Auth0 or Supabase Auth
- **Deployment**: Docker containers on AWS/GCP

## Implementation Strategy
Starting with MVP focusing on core collaboration features, then expanding to advanced functionality.
