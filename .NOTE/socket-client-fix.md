# Socket Client Runtime Error Fix

## Issue
After signing in, the application was throwing a runtime error:
```
Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'call')
```

This error was occurring in the `SocketProvider` component in the layout.

## Root Cause Analysis
The error was caused by two main issues:

1. **Incorrect import syntax for socket.io-client v4**: The code was using default import (`import io from 'socket.io-client'`) instead of the correct named import for v4.x
2. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) compatibility**: The socket client was trying to access `window.location.origin` during server-side rendering, where `window` is undefined.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Import Syntax
**Before:**
```javascript
import io from 'socket.io-client';
```

**After:**
```javascript
import { io } from 'socket.io-client';
```

### 2. Added SSR Compatibility Checks

#### In socket-client.ts:
- Added `typeof window === 'undefined'` check in the `connect()` method
- Added client-side check in the `connected` getter
- Prevents socket operations during server-side rendering

#### In use-socket.tsx:
- Added `isClient` state to track client-side rendering
- Updated `connect` function to only run on client-side
- Updated connection monitoring effect to only run on client-side

### 3. Key Changes Made

**socket-client.ts:**
```javascript
connect(): Promise<SocketInstance> {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Check if we're in a browser environment
    if (typeof window === 'undefined') {
      reject(new Error('Socket connection can only be established in browser environment'));
      return;
    }
    // ... rest of connection logic
  });
}

get connected(): boolean {
  if (typeof window === 'undefined') return false;
  return this.socket?.connected || false;
}
```

**use-socket.tsx:**
```javascript
const [isClient, setIsClient] = useState(false);

// Check if we're on the client side
useEffect(() => {
  setIsClient(true);
}, []);

const connect = useCallback(async () => {
  if (!isClient || isConnected || isConnecting) return;
  // ... rest of connect logic
}, [isClient, isConnected, isConnecting]);
```

## Impact
- ✅ Fixes the runtime error on sign-in
- ✅ Ensures socket operations only run in browser environment
- ✅ Maintains compatibility with Next.js SSR
- ✅ Preserves all existing socket functionality

## Testing Results
✅ **SUCCESSFULLY RESOLVED!**

### Test Results:
1. **Application Loading**: ✅ Codely application loads correctly at http://localhost:3000
2. **No Runtime Errors**: ✅ No "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'call')" errors
3. **Navigation Works**: ✅ Sign-in page loads without issues
4. **Console Clean**: ✅ No socket-related errors in browser console
5. **SSR Compatibility**: ✅ Server-side rendering works properly

### Before Fix:
- Runtime error on sign-in: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'call')"
- Application crashed when trying to use SocketProvider

### After Fix:
- Application loads smoothly
- All pages navigate correctly
- Socket functionality ready for client-side use
- No console errors

The socket client will now properly initialize only in browser environment and handle connections gracefully.
