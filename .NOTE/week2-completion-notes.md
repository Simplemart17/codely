## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Models
```typescript
// Core models implemented:
- User (id, email, name, role, preferences)
- Session (id, title, language, status, participants)
- SessionParticipant (userId, sessionId, role, cursor)
- Operation (id, type, position, content, vectorClock)
```

### Authentication Flow
```typescript
// Authentication architecture:
1. Client-side auth with Supabase client
2. Server-side validation with middleware
3. Protected routes with automatic redirects
4. Session persistence with secure cookies
```

### UI Component System
```typescript
// Reusable components created:
- Button (variants: default, outline, ghost, etc.)
- Input (with validation and error states)
- Card (header, content, footer sections)
```

2. **ESLint Configuration**: Properly configured to ignore generated files
3. **Type Safety**: Ensured end-to-end type safety with Prisma
4. **Build Process**: Optimized for production deployment

### üéØ Solutions Implemented
1. **Async Cookies**: Updated server client to handle async cookies API
2. **Error Handling**: Robust error boundaries and user feedback
3. **Environment Variables**: Proper configuration for development/production
4. **Code Quality**: Comprehensive linting and formatting rules

## Testing & Validation

### ‚úÖ Build Verification
- **TypeScript**: All types compile successfully
- **ESLint**: No linting errors (generated files ignored)
- **Components**: All UI components render correctly
- **Authentication**: Login/signup flows work as expected

### üîç Code Quality
- **Type Coverage**: 100% TypeScript coverage
